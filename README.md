# Repository Overview 
This repository contains Python code for self-driving cars that use computer vision and deep learning techniques to address problems that autonomous vehicles face, such as detecting lane lines and predicting steering angles in real-time.


## Project Setup

### OpenCV
![OpenCV](screenshots/opencv.png)

OpenCV stands for “Open Source Computer Vision” is a library for computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android, and Mac OS. 

## Use OpenCV to Load Image 
```python
image = cv2.imread('/data/Lane_Original.jpg')
```


# STEP 2: DETECT EDGES IN THE IMAGE 
# STEP 3: USE LANE EDGES TO DEFINE REGION OF INTEREST #
# STEP 4: ISOLATE REGION OF INTEREST IN THE IMAGE
# STEP 5: USE HOUGH TRANSFORM TO FIND LANE LINES 
# STEP 6: OPTIMIZE LANE LINES
